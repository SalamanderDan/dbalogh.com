    <h4>Problem 7.28</h4>
      <p>To start we solve for angular velocity, using the forumla w = v / r.</p>
      <p>This gives us a angular velocity of .25 radians per second.</p>
      <p>Using this we can solve for angular distance by theta = w * t.</p>
      <p>This gives us an angular distance of 60 radians.</p>
      <p>With this and radius we can solve for arc length by s = r * theta.</p>
      <p>Arc length is then 3600.</p>
    <h4>Problem 7.42</h4>
      <p></p>
    <h4>Problem 7.58</h4>
      <p>To solve we can start with the equation solving for time t = square root of (2 * height * gravity)</p>
      <p>This gives us a time of .777seconds.</p>
      <p>Now we solve for speed by a distance over time add in distance of the car.</p>
      <p>This gives us a speed of 14.02meters/second.</p>
      <p>Then using the equation of Ac = v squared divded by radius.</p>
      <p>This gives us a centripital acceleration of .59 meters per second squared.</p>
    <h4>Problem Chapter 8</h4>
      <p>We start by converting 2200rpm to radians per second.</p>
      <p>2200 / 60 to get 36.66 rps and * 2pi to get 230.4 radians per second.</p>
      <p>Then we solve angular acceleration by (final angV - initial angV) / time.</p>
      <p>So 0 - 230.4 / 40</p>
      <p>A. angular acceleration is -5.76 radians per second squared.</p>
      <p>Then using angular acceleration and moment of inertia (given) we can solve for torque.</p>
      <p>Torque is 16.47 newton meters.</p>
      <p>The force is then solved by torque divded radius.</p>
      <p>Force is 16.47 / .005m = -3294 newtons</p>
      <p>Work is solved by Inertia * angular velocity squared divided by 2.</p>
      <p>Work is then -75910.35 joules.</p>
