    <h4>Problem 7.28</h4>
      <p>To start we solve for angular velocity, using the forumla w = v / r.</p>
      <p>This gives us a angular velocity of .25 radians per second.</p>
      <p>Using this we can solve for angular distance by theta = w * t.</p>
      <p>This gives us an angular distance of 60 radians.</p>
      <p>With this and radius we can solve for arc length by s = r * theta.</p>
      <p>Arc length is then 3600.</p>

    <h4>Problem 7.58</h4>
      <p>To solve we can start with the equation solving for time t = square root of (2 * height * gravity)</p>
      <p>This gives us a time of .777seconds.</p>
      <p>Now we solve for speed by a distance over time add in distance of the car.</p>
      <p>This gives us a speed of 14.02meters/second.</p>
      <p>Then using the equation of Ac = v squared divded by radius.</p>
      <p>This gives us a centripital acceleration of .59 meters per second squared.</p>
